# Bank-Loan
This project would give you a comprehensive view of the bank’s loan portfolio and help identify trends and opportunities for improvement in loan management

Key Metrics for a Bank Loan Power BI Project:
Loan Amount: Total amount of loans disbursed.
Interest Rate: The rate charged on the loans.
Loan Type: Different types of loans (e.g., personal, mortgage, auto loans).
Repayment Status: Whether loans are paid on time, overdue, or defaulted.
Customer Demographics: Age, gender, income level, etc.
Loan Tenure: The length of time for which the loan is taken.
Total Repayment: Amount repaid including interest.
Steps to Build a Power BI Dashboard:
1. Data Collection and Preparation
First, gather the necessary data from bank systems. Typically, you will have the following datasets:

Loan Details: Loan amount, type, interest rate, tenure.
Customer Information: Customer age, gender, income, and location.
Loan Repayment Data: Repayment status, outstanding balance, overdue amounts.
Prepare this data in Excel, CSV, or connect directly to a database using Power BI’s built-in connectors (SQL Server, MySQL, etc.).

2. Load Data into Power BI
Open Power BI Desktop.
Click on Get Data and import the Excel, CSV, or database connection.
Clean the data using the Power Query Editor (e.g., remove nulls, rename columns, split columns if needed).
3. Data Model
If you're working with multiple datasets (e.g., customer, loan, repayment), you'll need to:

Create relationships between the datasets using keys (e.g., Customer ID, Loan ID).
Ensure the relationships are set up correctly in the Model View.
4. Create Measures and Calculations
Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated fields:

Total Loan Amount:
DAX
Copy code
Total Loan Amount = SUM(LoanData[LoanAmount])
Total Interest Earned:
DAX
Copy code
Total Interest = SUMX(LoanData, LoanData[LoanAmount] * LoanData[InterestRate] / 100)
Outstanding Loans:
DAX
Copy code
Outstanding Loans = SUM(LoanData[OutstandingAmount])
5. Visualizations
Total Loan Disbursement: A Card visual to show total loan amount disbursed.
Loan by Type: A Pie or Donut Chart to break down loans by type (e.g., personal, mortgage).
Loan Performance: Use a Stacked Column Chart to show on-time, overdue, and defaulted loans.
Customer Demographics: A Bar Chart or Stacked Bar Chart to show the age group or income level distribution of borrowers.
Repayment Status: A Matrix or Table visual to list customers with loan statuses and overdue amounts.
6. Filtering and Slicing
Use slicers to filter data based on:

Loan type (e.g., personal, home, auto).
Loan tenure (e.g., 5 years, 10 years).
Customer demographics (e.g., age range, income bracket).
7. KPIs and Insights
Loan-to-Income Ratio: Visualize the ratio between the loan amount and borrower income.
Repayment Trends: Show the trends over time using a line chart (e.g., total repayments made each month).
Risk Analysis: Highlight at-risk loans with overdue payments or those close to default using conditional formatting in tables.
8. Final Touches
Add a title and description for clarity.
Use tooltips to give users more insight when hovering over data points.
Ensure proper formatting and alignment to make the dashboard visually appealing and easy to interpret.
9. Publish and Share
Once your dashboard is complete:

Publish the report to the Power BI Service.
Share the dashboard with stakeholders, enabling them to interact with the data.
Additional Insights for a Bank Loan Dashboard:
Loan Default Prediction: Using historical data, you could apply machine learning models (outside Power BI) and display predictions of which loans are likely to default.
Loan Approval Rates: Show the approval rate by loan type and customer segment to understand trends in approvals.
Geographic Analysis: Use a Map Visual to analyze loan disbursements and repayment status across different regions.
Example Visuals for a Loan Dashboard:
Total Loans Disbursed: A card displaying total loans disbursed.
Loan Default Rate: A gauge showing the default rate.
Customer Distribution: A pie chart showing loan distribution by customer demographic (age, income).
Monthly Repayment Status: A bar chart showing loan repayments vs overdue amounts by month.
