🖥️🖥️ Implementation Steps:

a. Data Preparation
Clean and organize loan, customer, and repayment data.
Ensure consistent formats (e.g., date, amount, percentage) and handle missing or incorrect values.
Perform feature engineering (e.g., creating loan risk scores based on credit history, or time-lag features for repayment).

b. Data Integration
Load the prepared data into a Business Intelligence (BI) tool like Power BI, Tableau, or Excel Dashboard.
Set up data connections to automatically refresh the dashboard when new data is available.

c. Visualization Creation
Build visuals for each of the key sections outlined (loan performance, customer demographics, risk analysis, etc.).
Create appropriate interactivity and drill-down options.

d. Testing and Feedback
Test the dashboard with real-time data.
Gather feedback from financial analysts or loan officers for improvements in design or data accuracy.
